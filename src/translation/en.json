Every line of code was written to help you build habits that make a real difference.\n\nIf you feel that Dooit has supported you in some way, I’d appreciate it a lot if you contributed to its development - even with a virtual coffee. It’s a sign for me that what I’m doing matters.\n\n~ Mikołaj Bryksa"
